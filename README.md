# RFP-Management-System
An end-to-end AI-powered platform that automates the entire Request for Proposal (RFP) creation, evaluation, and lifecycle management process. This system reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and speeds up decision-making using LLMs, ML-based scoring, and workflow automation.

## Overview
The **AI-RFP-System** consists of two major components:

- *Backend* (Python/FastAPI)
  - Handles authentication, RFP ingestion, AI scoring, versioning, workflows, and database management.

- *Frontend* (React + Tailwind)
  - A clean UI for creating RFPs, reviewing AI-generated scores, managing proposals, and tracking status.

This project is designed to resemble real enterprise RFP automation software used in procurement, enterprise sales, and vendor management.
